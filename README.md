# GitHub Activity Automation

This repository uses GitHub Actions to maintain activity by automatically committing to the repository every day.

### How It Works:
- A workflow runs every day at **9 AM UTC**.
- It updates `activity_log.txt` with a new timestamp.
- The commit is pushed automatically to keep your GitHub profile active.

This ensures that your contribution graph stays green! ðŸš€
